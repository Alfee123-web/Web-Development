    <p><b>A Linked List flows,</b> a silver chain, Connecting thoughts within the brain. Nodes that whisper, pointers
        lead, To every bit of data we might need. <br>
        <!-- bold -->
        <br>The Stack builds high, <i>a tower of "Last," </i>To undo errors from the recent past. While Queues stand
        patient, first in line, To keep the logic smooth and fine. <br>
        <!-- italic -->
        <br><u>With C++ as the sturdy blade</u>, The foundation of the web is laid. Complexity yields to a plan
        well-sown, As every student makes the code their own
    </p>
